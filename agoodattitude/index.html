   <h3>The Beaver Creek Rift</h3>
   <div class="img-with-text"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/vhNnbjx/beavercreekrift.jpg"></div>
   <h3>One potential area of activity is the Beaver Creek Rift. Discovered in 1943 by an unnamed researcher, the flat stretch of land has become a site for attempted extraterrestrial contact. Visitors notice a dramatic increase in activity intercepted by radios and computers that are brought to the area. Some theorize that the rift could be an interdimensional portal, or a means for time travelâ€”how rad! The area is open to the public and sits just outside the campus of a local community college. That would be one hell of a field trip!</h3>
